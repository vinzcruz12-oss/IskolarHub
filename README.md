# 🎓 IskolarHub

IskolarHub is a web-based scholarship finder designed to help students easily discover scholarship opportunities through a centralized platform. Instead of searching across multiple websites and social media pages, students can browse, search, and filter scholarships based on their qualifications.

The platform also provides an admin dashboard that allows scholarship providers to create, update, and manage scholarship listings, making scholarship information more accessible to students.
